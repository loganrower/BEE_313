Assuming there is no ground heat flux, water advected energy, or storage of energy at the surface, what fraction of the incoming net radiation is converted to latent energy?"

    "On a late summer day, the floating weather station located in the center of Crater Lake recorded an average air temperature (at 2m) of 21.3C while the surface water temperature was 12.4C. At this same station, the wind speed and relative humidity were 2.6m/s and 45% (respectively). Because Cater Lake is so high, the air pressure is approximately 85% of standard air pressure and the equation to estimate the water vapor transfer coefficient based on lake area are not applicable. What is the expected daily ET in mm/day from the lake."

    "A new variety of potatoes has recently been developed that uses less water than traditional types. This new crop is planted in April and harvested in August. It has the following monthly crop coefficient values (April through August): Kc = [0.2, 0.5, 0.9, 0.6, 0.3]. Data from the local Agrimet station (HERO) gives the estimated monthly reference evapotranspiration for these months as: ETr = [124, 185, 233, 284, 245] in mm/month. You are asked to estimate the amount of irrigation water required to grow this new potato variety in Hermiston, OR. Assume that precipitation is minor and that irrigation during each month must match crop water use."

    "The known parameters given by the problem statement were documented. After which point the energy for warming was calculated, and thus the time to warm was then found. The next facet of the equation was to determin the ripening time. The max water that could be held within the snow pack was determined, and then used to find the ripening energy. This ripening energy was then inturn utilized to calculating the time to ripen. Finally the output energy from the water released from the snow pack after the maximum water held within the snow pack had been reached was computed to find it's associated time. The three times were summed in order to compute a total time. \n",

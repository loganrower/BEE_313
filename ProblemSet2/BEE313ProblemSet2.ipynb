    "The known parameters given by the problem statement were documented. After which point the energy for warming was calculated, and thus the time to warm was then found. The next facet of the equation was to determin the ripening time. The max water that could be held within the snow pack was determined, and then used to find the ripening energy. This ripening energy was then inturn utilized to calculating the time to ripen. Finally the output energy from the water released from the snow pack after the maximum water held within the snow pack had been reached was computed to find it's associated time. The three times were summed in order to compute a total time. \n",

Additionally the wind speed and relative humidity were found to be 2.6 m/s and 45%. The air pressure is 85% of standard air pressure at the lake.

It has the following monthly crop coefficient values (April through August): Kc = [0.2, 0.5, 0.9, 0.6, 0.3]. Data from the local Agrimet station (HERO) gives the estimated monthly reference evapotranspiration for these months as: ETr = [124, 185, 233, 284, 245] in mm/month. You are asked to estimate the amount of irrigation water required to grow this new potato variety in Hermiston, OR. Assume that precipitation is minor and that irrigation during each month must match crop water use."

In these soils, tests have shown that the volumetric soil water content at which this grape becomes stressed is 0.42 cm3/cm3. If this grape were to be grown in sandy soils elsewhere in Oregon, what would the volumetric water content at which this vine become stressed be assuming the Campbell pedotransfer function represents these soils well."

At the time that infiltration reaches these soil probes, how many cm of surface runoff (infiltration excess) may have occurred within this catchment if the initial soil water content is 35% by volume."

These two rivers, which are approximately 6.2km apart, both flow north in parallel with Millersburg in between. If the Willamette River has a surface elevation of 52m above sea level and the Santiam River has a surface elevation of 65m above sea level, what is the expected height of the water table at Millersburg (which is 2.3km from the Willamette River)? Below the Willamette valley the confining layer has a height of about 45m above sea level, the average annual recharge is about 500 mm/year, and the hydraulic conductivity is 51.8m/day."

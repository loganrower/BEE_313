    "A 10 km2 catchment located within the foothills of the Cascades has an average annual rainfall of 1750 mm/year and an average annual stream flow of 0.3 m3/sec. Based on data from meteorological stations located within the basin, it is estimated that the average ET is 4 mm/day. Given the location of this catchment, it is hypothesized that it may have strong groundwater inputs or outputs. Based on these flows, what is the groundwater contribution to this basin in each year in mm/year (with positive being out of the basin)?\n",
